# Conditional Drills: If/Else Statements in JavaScript

This exercise is designed to help you practice writing **conditional statements** using `if`, `else if`, and `else` in JavaScript. Conditional logic is an essential part of programming as it allows you to control the flow of your code based on different conditions.

By completing these drills, you will:

- Write basic condition checks using `if` statements.  
- Use `else` and `else if` to handle multiple conditions.  
- Work with comparisons, logical operators, and different scenarios.  
- Test and debug your code to ensure it produces the correct output.

## Instructions

1. **Set up your environment**:
   - Fork & Clone this repo. Starter code and prompts are in `conditionals.js`).
   - Use Node.js to run the file in your terminal (`node conditionals.js`).

2. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Each drill has a **description** and a variable setup provided for you.
   - Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to implement the logic needed to meet the requirements.

3. **Test your code**:
   - Run your program with the provided inputs.
   - Modify the variables to test additional scenarios and ensure your code works for edge cases.

4. **Code formatting**:
   - Use clean and consistent formatting (proper indentation and comments).
   - Add comments to explain your logic if needed.

5. **Submission**:
   - Complete all drills in the file.
   - Push your work your forked copy, create a pull request on the original repo, and then submit your URL on Google Classroom.
   - Be prepared to explain how your code works.

Happy coding and good luck! ðŸš€
